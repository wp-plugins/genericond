Shortcode: `[genericon icon=twitter]`

== Installation ==

Install as a normal WordPress Plugin

Add shortcode or HTML to your posts, pages and even widgets to display a Genericons icon.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Aren't they called Genericons with an S? =

Yes, but Genericon'd is a Zaboo-esque sort of way of saying 'These icons have been genericonified!' I was in a The Guild frame of mind. Also since this is not the official plugin, I didn't want to use that slug.

= What are all the codes to use? =

If you're like me, you forget this alllll the time. On your WP dashboard, go to Apperance -> Genericon'd. The page there will show you everything you need to know about using Genericons.

= Can I add it to menus? =

Yes! If you use CSS classes, you can apply a class like this:  `genericon genericon-facebook` You may need to jigger about with css to make the layout perfect.

= Why don't these work on IE 7? =

Genericons itself <strong>does not come with fallback icons by default</strong> -- therefore you have to create them yourself. If you are using HTML similar to this example: <code>&lt;span class="genericon genericon-warning"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code>

You can use the asterisk hack to serve a different icon to IE7 once you have saved the fallback icons to your project:

<pre>.genericon-warning {
    *background: url(fallback-icon.png) no-repeat center center;
    *text-indent: 100%;
}
</pre>
