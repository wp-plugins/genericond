== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Aren't they called Genericons with an S? =

Yes, but Genericon'd is a Zaboo-esque sort of way of saying 'These icons have been genericonified!' I was in a The Guild frame of mind. Also since this is not the official plugin, I didn't want to use that slug.

= What are all the codes to use? =

If you're like me, you forget this alllll the time. On your WP dashboard, go to Apperance -> Genericon'd. The page there will show you everything you need to know about using Genericons.

= Can I add it to menus? =

Yes! If you use CSS classes, you can apply a class like this:  `genericon genericon-facebook` You may need to jigger about with css to make the layout perfect.
